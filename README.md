Motivation
----------
This project analyzes prairie dog colony data from the Boulder Open Data project in an attempt to identify prairie dog colonies via aerial images, clustering the different prairie dog mounds together and predicting the perimeter and areas based on these clusters. I have always been fascinated by Ecology and ecosystems so when presented with an opportunity to work with prairie dog data I could not pass up the opportunity. If you did not know prairie dogs are keystone species and play a vital role in maintaining North American grasslands ecosystems[1]. The goal of this project is to tackle a problem that could benefit Ecologist by eliminating the need to do lengthly ground surveys, saving time to allow for other areas of focus without the loss of important annual data.

Data
----
Each fall Ecologists with Open Space Mountain Parks map the perimeter of each colony which provides data on the extent of the colony.

The Boulder prairie dog data contains:
- 21 years of data from 1996 to 2016
- 146 different areas as of 2016
- Geospatial data for each of the areas
- Measurements of the perimeter and area for the associated colonies
