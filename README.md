Motivation
----------
This project analyzes the prairie dog colony data from the Boulder Open Data project in an attempt to identify prairie dog colonies via aerial images, clustering the different prairie dog mounds together and predicting the perimeter and areas based on these clusters. I have always been fascinated by Ecology and wanted to tackle a problem that could benefit Ecologist. The idea of this project is to Eliminate the need to do lengthly ground surveys of the areas, saving time by using annual aerial images while obtaining the same area data or more precise area data.
